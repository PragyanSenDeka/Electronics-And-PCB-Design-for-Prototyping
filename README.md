# ⚡ Electronics and PCB Design for Product Development

> **A beginner-friendly, self-paced certified course by IIM Calcutta Innovation Park Technology and Innovation Council**

Welcome to this hands-on course where we learn **electronics and PCB design by building**, not memorizing.  
Each concept is taught through:
1. 🎥 A short YouTube lesson  
2. 🧠 A fun Google Form quiz and Projects 
3. 🛠️ Gradual progress toward real-world PCB projects  

No prior PCB experience required. Curiosity is mandatory.
