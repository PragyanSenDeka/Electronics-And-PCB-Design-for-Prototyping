#  Electronics and PCB Design for Product Development

> **A beginner-friendly, self-paced certified course by IIM Calcutta Innovation Park Technology and Innovation Council**

Welcome to this hands-on course where we learn **electronics and PCB design by building**, not memorizing.  
No prior PCB experience required. Curiosity is mandatory.

##  What You’ll Learn

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Understand core electronics concepts used in real products  
- Design schematics and PCBs using **KiCad**  
- Apply good PCB design practices (not just “it works”)  
- Build confidence to design your own hardware prototypes
